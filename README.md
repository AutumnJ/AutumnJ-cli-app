# PetsSeekingPeople

## A CLI Gem to Locate Adoptable Dogs & Cats in Your Area! 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pets_seeking_people'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pets_seeking_people

## Usage

Once installed, execute:

    $ pets_seeking_people

When prompted, enter:
1) The type of pet you're searching for (dog or cat -- the adoption of other pets is always supported, just not by this gem)
2) Your zip code 

After some computer magic occurs, view 24 pets available for adoption in the given zip code! Follow the menu prompts to learn more about each pet, and obtain contact info for the organization you can connect with to adopt them.

Adopt away!
