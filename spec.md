Specs:

[X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
	Users can interact with the application by:
	1) Selecting the type of pet they're searching for (dog vs cat),
	2) Inputting their zip code,
	3) Viewing a numbered list of available pets in that zip code,
	4) Inputting a number from the list to access more details about that animal,
	5) Using the menu options to view the list again, view detailed info on another animal, or exit
[X] Pull data from an external source
    Pull data from ASPCA site based on dog v. cat input & zip code input. Pull from index/search page and from detailed page specific to each animal.
[X] Implement both list and detail views
	List view displays basic info about animals available for adoption (name, breed, age, gender). 
	Detail view displays list of additional facts, and contact info (name, address, phone, email) for organization people can connect with to adopt that pet. 
	Additional option to pull in detailed paragraphs about animal. Commented out in scraper as it's likely too much info for terminal view. Can comment back in to view.
